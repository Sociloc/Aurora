# Aurora

## Introduction
Aurora is a powerful large language model optimized to efficiency and low computation. While leveraging the transformer architecture this model is made possible. Aurora is trained on large datasets, and then fine-tuned to produce useful answers. As a low computation and open-source model, Aurora simplifies LLMs for everyone, both in training and in utilisation. (NOTE: Aurora is based on a highly mathematical algorithms which trains on data, given this, Aurora can make mistakes and it is not fully perfect and reliable.)
